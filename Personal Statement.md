I am an undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Since 2017, I have dedicated seven years to algorithm competitions.

I have got a gold medal in ICPC EC Regional Contest, and entered the ICPC EC Final last year.

I have extensive experience in algorithm education. Previously, I worked as a course architect and led my own problem-setting team. Additionally, I frequently delve into complex problems and refine the algorithms I have already mastered.

During high school, I combined two types of weight-balanced trees, WBLT and Treap, to develop a [new balanced tree](https://wild-donkey.github.io/Datastructure/FHQ_Weight_Baclanced_Leafy_Tree/) that inherits the high performance of WBLT while enabling efficient interval operations.

Another example is [a group project](https://github.com/leixy2004/project_hw_mass_store), where I enhanced Kruskal algorithm, simulated annealing, disjoint-set, and bucket sort. This resulted in a novel algorithm tailored to meet my teamâ€™s specific needs. 

I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C++, and Rust, and have experience with machine learning frameworks like PyTorch. I have studied the fundamental theories of machine learning and analyzed the codebases of large language models such as LLaMA.

I'm glad to learn that your team is working on time series analysis and making valuable contributions to anomaly detection and prediction in industry. Driven by my passion for applying my skills to real-world challenges, I am eager to acquire deeper knowledge and take part in these inspiring efforts.
