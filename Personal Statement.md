I am an undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Since 2017, I have dedicated seven years to algorithm competitions.

I have got a gold medal in ICPC EC Regional Contest, and entered the ICPC EC Final last year.

I have extensive experience in algorithm education. Previously, I worked as a course architect and led my own problem-setting team. Additionally, I frequently delve into complex problems and refine the algorithms I have already mastered.

During high school, I combined two types of weight-balanced trees, WBLT and FHQ_Treap, to develop a [new balanced tree](https://wild-donkey.github.io/Datastructure/FHQ_Weight_Baclanced_Leafy_Tree/) that inherits the high performance of WBLT while enabling efficient interval operations.

Another example is [a group project](https://github.com/leixy2004/project_hw_mass_store), where I enhanced Kruskal algorithm, simulated annealing, disjoint-set, and bucket sort. This resulted in a novel algorithm tailored to meet my teamâ€™s specific needs. 

I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C++, and Rust, and have experience with machine learning frameworks like PyTorch. I have studied the fundamental theories of machine learning and analyzed the codebases of large language models such as LLaMA.

I'm glad to learn that your team is working on time series analysis and making valuable contributions to anomaly detection and prediction in industry. Driven by my passion for applying my skills to real-world challenges, I am eager to acquire deeper knowledge and take part in these inspiring efforts.


> Q: Tell us about your "Research on Cost-Effective Continuous Learning Method of Edge Intelligence Model Based on Data Clipping" project.
> A:I worked as a research assistant on this project, where our goal was to enable AI models to learn continuously rather than relying on full datasets all at once. We believed this approach would reduce the impact of data shift/concept drift. Our proposed solution involved using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to process data from different domains efficiently. The project is still in its early stages, and there is significant work ahead to refine and validate our methods. 

> Q: Tell us about your project "Research on Search Algorithm of Vector Database Based on Routing."
> A: This project focuses on graph-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for vector databases. Our plan is to evaluating the efficiency of different routing algorithms, implementing them in code, and conducting performance tests. As a research assistant, once the coding is completed, I will assist in writing the research paper to document our findings.
